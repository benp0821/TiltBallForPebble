# TiltBallForPebble

A quick game I made where you use the accelerometer on the Pebble watch to control a small circle by tilting the watch. The goal is to collect the black circles while avoiding running into the edges of the screen, and achieve a high score. As you collect the circles, the character will slowly get larger and more unwieldy. This is a sample program making use of the accelerometer of the Pebble watch.
